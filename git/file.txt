In bash scripting, an arithmetic expansion can
 also be performed using backticks and expr 
(known as all-purpose expression evaluator). The 
`expr` is similar to 'let,' but it does not save 
the result to a variable. It directly prints the 
result. Unlike let, we don't need to enclose the
 expression within the quotes. We are required to 
use spaces between the items of the expression. 
It is important to note that we should use 'expr` 
within command substitution to save the output to a variable.
